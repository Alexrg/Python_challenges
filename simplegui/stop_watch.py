Our mini-project for this week will focus on combining text drawing in the
canvas with timers to build a simple digital stopwatch that keeps track of the
time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch should contain "Start", "Stop" and
"Reset" buttons.

This code can only be run in https://py3.codeskulptor.org/ since simplegui
only works there. Create an interactive console thet greets the user.
